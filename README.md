# binaryConverter
A minimalist tool for quickly doing common binary/ hexadecimal/ decimal conversion tasks.

This tool allows you to type in any base and it will convert the number on the fly to the other supported bases / representations.

# TODO
- add support for expressions such as basic arthmetic functions: "1111 0000 + 0000 1111"
